            <p>
                Late in 2015, we (Tim and Lez) set off to watch UFC 193. The hype in Melbourne was all around the Rhonda Rousey VS Holly Holm fight and we wanted to get in on the action. We were excited, pumped, nervous as many UFC fans were.  After visiting our local pub, we were left flat, frustrated and annoyed that they had not subscribed to the fight and weren't showing it.  Shattered.

                Frantically, we started searching Google looking for venues showing the fight and how quickly we could get there so we didn't miss it. In the end, for peace of mind, to ensure we could watch it, we resorted to going to Crown Casino. Everything was right in the world again.  However, this painful experience led to the "kick off" (sorry for the pun) of SportAnatics,
                where we link you, the sports fans, to the venues showing the live sports that you want to see.
